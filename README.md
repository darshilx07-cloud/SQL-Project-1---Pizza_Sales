# SQL-Project-1---Pizza_Sales
This project presents an **Annual Pizza Sales SQL Report**, showcasing practical SQL queries applied to a real-world pizza sales dataset. It covers **Basic (5), Intermediate (5), and Advanced (3) SQL queries**, demonstrating key analytical tasks such as calculating total revenue, identifying top-selling pizzas, analyzing order distribution, and measuring category-wise and cumulative sales performance.

Through this project, I practiced query structuring, joins, grouping, and optimization while gaining hands-on experience in data analysis with SQL. The dataset and SQL scripts are included for reproducibility and learning.
